TODOS:

1) When dragging, make top-most z-index.
2) Make New Talk modal.  Duh.  Ditch the varying grid on isAdmin toggle.  Taht was dumb.
3) When done dragging, two talks should not be able to occupy same spot.  Send the other talk to the next available
3) Change next available to not just look at where existing talks are, to look by track and slot.  If Track 1 Slot 3 is open, it should go there even if there's a Track 2 Slot 3 talk.
4) Space out talks, add the slot times to the left and right column
5) Figure out the responsive view.
	- Grouped by track?
	- Grouped by slot?
